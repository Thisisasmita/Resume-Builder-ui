##  Approach

The project follows a two-panel layout:

Left Side (Customization Panel):
Contains all input fields for personal information, education, projects, and more. Users can add or delete entries dynamically.

Right Side (Live Preview Panel):
Displays the real-time resume preview as the user fills in details.

React’s useState hooks were used to store and update data dynamically. This made the entire process smooth and responsive without page reloads.
